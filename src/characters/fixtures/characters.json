Alpha would use the exclamation \"Ai yi yi\" in moments which invoked emotions of any kind, from panic to elation (most commonly panic); in more extreme situations, the exclamation could contain four \"yi\"'s, five \"yi\"'s or, in rare cases, six or seven \"yi\"'s; this has become a well-known catchphrase for most of the Alpha robots. He worked in the Command Center most of the time, only getting out on a few occasions, and almost always obeyed every command and order that Zordon issued. Surprisingly, while Alpha 5 is a robot, he has an amazing range of emotions that make him very humanlike."

This especially has a tremendous effect on Trini, who had been training in the art with her sensei, Master Li, and she decides to fight the monster alone in a later encounter in order to maintain her honor. However, once Mantis loses the one-on-one standoff match, Mantis resorts to receiving help from the putties and this leaves Trini asking \"What about your honor?\" The Mantis gives her the most fitting response applicable. \"I have no honor. Like you said, I am one of Rita's monsters.\" Luckily for Trini, her friends show up in time to help her defeat the Mantis. Trini feels that she did have honor because she gave the Mantis a fair fight even though the Mantis eventually resorted to ganging up on her. Mantis then grew into giant form and was destroyed by the Megazord's Power Sword."

The Megazord and Dragonzord then battled the Two-Headed Parrot with neither side gaining an upper hand. The zord attacks seemed to only agitate the parrot, rather than weaken it, so they formed the Ultrazord. After the Ultrazord was formed the Two-Headed Parrot cowered before the Ultrazord, begging them not to use it on it. Jason then apologetically\u00a0explained that they had no choice, and then it was destroyed by the Ultrazord.
